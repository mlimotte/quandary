# Quandary DSL Reference

Quandary is a Clojure library that wraps Google's OR-Tools CP-SAT constraint solver. It lets you define constraint satisfaction and optimization problems using a high-level DSL. The `qdsl` macro is the recommended way to express problems; `solve` takes the output of `qdsl` (or `collate`) and returns solutions.

Constraint solvers work by letting you describe *what* a valid solution looks like — variable domains (the set of values each variable may take) and constraints (rules that a solution must satisfy) — and then searching for assignments that satisfy all constraints simultaneously. Unlike general-purpose optimization algorithms, they excel at problems with hard combinatorial structure: discrete variables, strict logical requirements, and large but navigable search spaces. They can find one solution, all solutions, or an optimal solution with respect to an objective function (e.g. minimize cost), and they can prove infeasibility when no solution exists.

Constraint programming is widely used across many industries: **manufacturing and supply chain** (production scheduling, machine assignment, shift planning), **logistics** (vehicle routing, warehouse slotting, delivery sequencing), **architecture and engineering** (spatial layout, structural configuration), **finance** (portfolio construction with regulatory constraints, trade allocation), **telecommunications** (network configuration, frequency assignment). Anywhere a problem involves selecting values from discrete sets subject to a set of rules, a constraint solver is likely a natural fit.

FYI, my personal motivation for writing this project was to solve problems in the architecture space. Physical layouts. Constraint solvers were new to me when I began the project-- so step one was just learning that they exist.

## Quickstart

```clojure
(require '[quandary.api :refer [solve qdsl]])

(solve (qdsl {}
          {"r" [:range 0 100]
           "p" [:range 0 100]}
          [= (+ "r" "p") 20]
          [= (+ (* 4 "r") (* 2 "p")) 56])
       {:enumerate-all true})
;; => [{"r" 8, "p" 12}]
```

## `qdsl` Macro Syntax

```
(qdsl options-map domain-or-equation-form ...)
```

The body consists of any number of domain maps and equation vectors, interleaved in any order.  NOTE: This is NOT imperative programming, these equations are all solved simultaneously-- order is not relevant.

### Options Map (first arg)

Required; pass `{}` if no options are needed.

| Key | Description                                                                                                    |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:tag` | String. Attaches provenance metadata to the result; useful for debugging or conditional runtime checks.        |
| `:tap-entries` | Boolean. When `true`, taps the intermediate entry structure for inspection via `tap>`. |
| `:initial-context` | A `{:domain …, :equations …}` map that is collated with the body before processing.                            |

### Domain Maps

Each domain map entry is a string variable name mapped to a domain spec:

```clojure
{"x"               [:range 0 20]          ; integer in [0, 20] (both bounds inclusive)
 "flag"            [:boolean]             ; 0 or 1
 "size"            [5]                    ; fixed constant: always 5
 "color"           [1 2 3 4]             ; enumerated: one of these values
 "task"            [:fixed-size-interval "task.start" 5]
                                          ; scheduling interval of fixed size 5,
                                          ; anchored at variable "task.start"
 "task2"           [:optional-fixed-size-interval "t2.start" "t2.present" 3]
                                          ; optional interval: present only if "t2.present"=1
 ["a" "b"]         [:tuples [[1 2]        ; tuple constraint: (a=1,b=2) or (a=3,b=4)
                             [3 4]]]}     ;   are the only allowed assignments
```

Multiple domain maps can appear in the `qdsl` body and are merged together.

### Equation Vectors

Format: `[operator arg1 arg2 ...]`

- The operator is a bare symbol (not quoted, not a string).
- Arguments are polynomials: string variable names, arithmetic s-expressions, or numeric literals.

```clojure
[= (+ "x" "y") 10]          ; x + y = 10
[<= "x" "y"]                 ; x <= y
[<= 0 "x" 10]               ; 0 <= x <= 10  (three-argument range form)
```

Comparison operators support a three-argument range form: `[<= lo expr hi]` constrains `lo <= expr <= hi`.

**Supported operators:**

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `=` `!=` `<=` `<` `>=` `>` | Arithmetic comparison |
| `=>` | Boolean implication: `[=> "a" "b"]` means `a => b` |
| `add-bool-or` | At least one of the given boolean vars is true |
| `add-bool-and` | All of the given boolean vars are true |
| `add-bool-xor` | XOR constraint: an odd number of the given boolean vars must be true |
| `at-least-one` | At least one of the given boolean literals is true |
| `add-max-equality` | `target = max(arg1, arg2, ...)` |
| `add-min-equality` | `target = min(arg1, arg2, ...)` |
| `add-abs-equality` | `target = abs(arg)` |
| `add-modulo-equality` | `target = var mod divisor` |
| `add-division-equality` | `target = numerator / denominator` (truncates toward zero) |
| `no-overlap-2d` | 2D rectangle non-overlap scheduling constraint |
| `add-hint` | Provide a solver hint: `[add-hint "var" value]` |

> **Boolean aggregate usage in `qdsl`:** `add-bool-or`, `add-bool-and`, `add-bool-xor`, and `at-least-one` each take a *single* polynomial argument containing all the participating variables. Pack them with `+`:
> ```clojure
> [add-bool-or (+ "a" "b" "c")]   ; at least one of a, b, c is true
> [add-bool-and (+ "x" "y")]      ; both x and y are true
> ```
> Listing them as separate arguments (e.g. `[add-bool-or "a" "b" "c"]`) will throw an arity error at runtime.

### Arithmetic in Equations

Use Clojure arithmetic s-expressions inside equation vectors. `+`, `-`, and `*` are recognized by the macro and expanded into the internal polynomial format at runtime:

```clojure
[= (+ "x" (* 2 "y")) 10]    ; x + 2y = 10
[= (- "a" "b") 0]           ; a - b = 0
[= (* "a" "b") "c"]         ; a * b = c  (non-linear multiplication)
```

Other Clojure expressions in argument position are evaluated normally at runtime:

```clojure
(let [n 9]
  (qdsl {}
        {"answer" [:range 0 100]}
        ;; `inc` is clojure.core/inc and is evaluated before the result is embedded in the equation 
        [= "answer" (inc n)]))   ; answer = 10
```

Note that `+`, `-`, and `*` are intercepted by `qdsl` and treated as polynomial constructors, not ordinary Clojure functions. Use other Clojure calls — `inc`, `dec`, `quot`, `Math/abs`, etc. — when you want to compute a constant value before it enters the solver.

### Variable Names: `$` and `$#`

All variables submitted to the CP-SAT solver share a single global namespace — every name must be unique across the entire problem. `$` is a mechanism for constructing unique names from a runtime prefix, giving functions the illusion of local or scoped variables.

- `($ prefix "suffix")` → `"prefix.suffix"`
- `($# prefix "suffix")` → `"TEMP.prefix.suffix"` — TEMP variables are hidden from output, but otherwise behave the same.

The first argument (`prefix`) can be:
- A **String** — used directly as the prefix: `($ "kitchen" "width")` → `"kitchen.width"`
- A **Map** with a `:quandary.quandary/var-name-prefix` key — that string is used as the prefix. This lets you pass around a Clojure map representing an "object" and derive variable names from it: `($ room "width")` where `room` is `{::q/var-name-prefix "kitchen" ...}` → `"kitchen.width"`

Without `$`, a helper function that introduces variables like `"width"` and `"height"` could only safely be called once — a second call would produce duplicate names. By accepting a prefix and constructing names with `$`, the same function can be called for many objects and produce distinct, non-colliding variables for each:

```clojure
(defn room-constraints [room-name max-perimeter]
  (qdsl {}
    {($ room-name "width")  [:range 1 500]
     ($ room-name "height") [:range 1 500]}
    [<= (+ ($ room-name "width") ($ room-name "height")) max-perimeter]))

(solve (collate
         (room-constraints "kitchen" 100)
         (room-constraints "bedroom" 80)))
;; Variables: "kitchen.width", "kitchen.height", "bedroom.width", "bedroom.height"
```

Equations in one fragment can also reference variables defined in another simply by constructing the same name — `($ "kitchen" "width")` refers to the same solver variable wherever it appears.

By convention, `.` is used to separate hierarchical components of a variable name — e.g. `"floor.room.width"`, `"task.3.start"`. This is just a naming convention; the solver treats the name as an opaque string. This makes it easier to read model output, filter variables by pattern during debugging, and reason about which "object" a variable belongs to.

`$#` works identically but strips the variable from the solution map. It is used in `quandary.relations` functions like `mean` and `sqrto`, which introduce intermediate variables (accumulators, shadow vars) that are implementation details and should not appear in results.

## Conditional Constraints: `:only-enforce-if`

Use `:only-enforce-if` to conditionally apply a group of constraints based on the value of a boolean variable. Each branch can contain any number of equations:

```clojure
(qdsl {}
  {"mode" [:boolean]
   "x"    [:range 0 100]
   "y"    [:range 0 100]}
  [:only-enforce-if "mode"
   [= "x" 10]
   [= "y" 20]
   [<= "x" "y"]
   :only-enforce-else
   [= "x" 50]
   [= "y" 50]])
```

`:only-enforce-else` is optional. When omitted, the else branch is unconstrained — the solver is free to assign any values to variables that would otherwise have been governed by the else block:

```clojure
(qdsl {}
  {"active" [:boolean]
   "x"      [:range 0 100]}
  [:only-enforce-if "active"
   [= "x" 42]
   [<= "x" 50]])
;; When active=0, x is unconstrained within [0, 100]
```

> **Warning: `:only-enforce-if` does not imply the converse.**
>
> `:only-enforce-if pred [= x y]` means: *if `pred` is true, then enforce `x = y`*. It does **not** mean: *if `pred` is false, then `x ≠ y`*. When the predicate is false the equation is simply not enforced — the solver may still satisfy it or not. If you need to enforce the opposite when `pred` is false, you must say so explicitly with `:only-enforce-else`.

> **The predicate must be a boolean variable name or its negation.**
>
> The predicate after `:only-enforce-if` must be a boolean variable string (e.g. `"flag"`) or the negation of one via `(quandary.quandary/! "flag")`. It cannot be an arbitrary expression, a comparison, or an integer-range variable.

## `solve` Options

```clojure
(solve problem
       {:timeout            20.0   ; seconds to run before stopping (default: 20)
        :enumerate-all      true   ; find all solutions (incompatible with :num-workers > 1)
        :num-workers        4      ; parallel workers (default: 0 = all cores)
        :relative-gap-limit 0.05   ; stop when within 5% of optimal
        :objective          [:minimize "cost"]  ; or [:maximize "cost"]
        :limit              10     ; cap the number of returned solutions
        :check-inbalance?   false  ; disable mismatch check (default: true)
        :retain-temp?       true}) ; include TEMP variables in results (default: false)
```

By default, `solve` checks that every variable in the domain appears in at least one equation and every variable named in an equation has a domain entry. Unconstrained variables slow the solver significantly and are usually a mistake. Pass `:check-inbalance? false` to suppress this check.

## Combining Problems with `collate`

`collate` merges multiple `{:domain …, :equations …}` maps into one problem. Equations from all maps are concatenated. Domain entries are merged, and **duplicate variable names throw an error** — each variable must appear in exactly one map's domain.

```clojure
(require '[quandary.api :refer [solve qdsl collate]])

(solve (collate
         (qdsl {} {"x" [:range 0 10]} [= "x" 5])
         (qdsl {} {"y" [:range 0 10]} [= "y" (* 2 "x")])))
```

Higher-level relation functions in `quandary.relations` (e.g. `mean`, `sqrto`, `variance`) return collatable maps for use with `collate`.

## `qdsl-from-resource`

Loads a problem definition from an EDN file on the classpath, with parameterized variable name injection:

```clojure
(qdsl-from-resource {:tag "my-problem"} "problems/layout.edn" [room-width room-height])
```

The EDN file begins with an options map containing an `:in` key listing parameter names (matched positionally to the `args` vector), followed by domain maps and equation vectors in the same format as `qdsl`:

```edn
{:in [room-width room-height]}
{"width"  [:range 0 room-width]
 "height" [:range 0 room-height]}
[<= (+ "width" "height") 100]
```

---

## Appendix A: What `qdsl` Compiles To

`qdsl` compiles to a plain Clojure map:

```clojure
{:domain    {"a" [:range 0 5], "b" [:range 0 5]}
 :equations [...]}
```

Equations are sequences of the form `(operator polynomial ...)` — an operator symbol followed by one or more polynomial arguments. Each polynomial is a vector of terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `["x"]` | variable x (coefficient 1) |
| `[2 "x"]` | 2x |
| `["x" "y"]` | x · y |
| `[5]` | constant 5 |

Example:

```clojure
(:equations (qdsl {}
              {"a" [:range 0 5] "b" [:range 0 5]}
              [= (+ "a" (* 2 "b")) 10]))
;; => ((= [["a"] [2 "b"]] [[10]]))
```

This is the format accepted by `quandary.quandary/solve-equations` directly.

---

## Appendix B: String Equation Syntax

For quick exploration, `quandary.quandary/parse-equations` accepts a simple infix string syntax:

```clojure
(require '[quandary.quandary :as q])

(q/solve-equations
  {"r" [:range 0 100]
   "p" [:range 0 100]}
  (q/parse-equations "r + p = 20"
                     "4 r + 2 p = 56"))
;; => [{"r" 8, "p" 12}]
```

Limitations: supports only `+`, `-`, `*`, and basic comparison operators (`=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`). No boolean operators, tuple constraints, or `:only-if` modifiers. `qdsl` is recommended for all non-trivial use.
